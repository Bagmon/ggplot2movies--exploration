# ggplot2movies--exploration

See [ggplot2movies.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2movies/ggplot2movies.pdf) for details on the ggplot2movies package

## Goal

I'd like to see what insights this data set can give into movie profit. For example:
  How due different genre's profits compare 
  How does rating corelate with profit
  What are the trends in rating or votes over the course of time and/or genre
